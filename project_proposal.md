## Introduction

This article and tool specifically focus on learning Mandarin Chinese as a second language. The goal of this project is to provide a tool that will aid in that learning process. This prototype will reflect portions of the overall technology that will go into and be necessary for the finalized tool. After reading this article you will not only understand the inspiration and the many ideas and stages this project has come through and will go through but you will also understand the importance of this project and the feasibility of it.

## Literature Review

Language, as much as it enables us to communicate it also confines us. We can use language to communicate and we also need it to communicate. Our understanding of the world comes through language. In order for anything to make sense or for us to make sense of anything we rely on language. It is the lens through which all has to pass.(COMM 120 article). Often times the language we speak is something we don't often think about and are surrounded by, like water to a fish. The languages we speak change our physical anatomy. Language impacts the wiring of our brains and the ways they fire. People who have a different structured language will use different parts of their brains and in different orders in order to speak (find articles about this). The English language is a subject verb noun language (article) and so when people go to speak in English they first think about the who, the subject, and then immediately say the verb, whereas in Arabic the verb can come before the noun, other romance languages don't always include subjects, and in Chinese the verb goes at the end of the sentence. Languages are all constructed differently. Language for good or for worse defines our reality.

### the importance of language
Blank ## of people only speak one language in their lives. However, there are many benefits to learning a second language. First studies show it can improve your memory(article). Learning languages expands our knowledge and understanding. Secondly, it helps us better understand and appreciate our native tongues. It expands our perspective because things you take for granted, like the verb following the subject, you realize, are not always a given. Thirdly, learning another language can open doors and reveal broader opportunities for us. It helps you become more of a cross cultural and more cross culturally aware person. It opens doors to new communities. As Treveoh Noah, the comedian, says in his book, Born A Crime, "A shared language says "We're the same." A language barrier says "We're different." Learning a language is a way to step out of your own world and into someone else's world. It's a way to make an effort to understand others. 
Finally, in learning a language not only will you learn about others, but you will learn more about yourself. Everyone learns differently. Our brains all work differently. (research more about different learning methods and insert a discussion about that here - bigger headings: language into, the importance of learning languages, different ways people learn, different resources, the way the Chinese language works). There are many different ways to learn and there are many different ways to help facilitate learning. How people learn and therefore how to teach them, specifically languages, is all connected. There are many resources and articles that discussion second language learning and teaching. These topics have been a topic long under discussion. (find more articles about this). For example ARTICLE explores a teaching idea to engage elementary students in learning more about another language and culture. This article is specifically geared towards learning Mandarin as a second language. The idea centers around having a topic of study and then splitting the classroom up into groups to explore different facets of the topic. The kids will work together to learn about their specific topic and they will then present their findings to their classmates. In addition to different teaching methods, there are also articles about self learning methods and tools. 

# the basics of Mandarin
Learning Mandarin is said to be one of the hardest languages for English speakers to understand and master(get stats form gov??, also language tree image). There are many aspects that make Mandarin hard. For instance, the writing system for Mandarin does not teach one how to pronounce different words. So if a person is trying to learn the word for dog it will take more than just memorizing the word "perro" as is the translation to Spanish. The mandarin pinyin letters for the Chinese word dog are "g", "o", and "u"(CHECK TONE). However, these letters only tell a person one part of how to say the word. Mandarin is a tonal language, which means in order to correctly say the word, one must know which of the four/five tones to say --sometimes people count the non tonal words as a fifth tone. This isn't always a huge translation barrier, especially as a beginner. People can often understand what a person is saying from context clues and association with other words in the sentence, this will only become really important when you know so many words that you need the tones to be able to differentiate what people are saying. But as with anything it is important to build good habits from the beginning because it is much harder to break bad habits than make good ones from the beginning. In our example the word "gou" has BLANK tone. Then, after knowing both the letters, which help pronunciation for those with a native language that has an alphabet, and knowing the tone comes learning how to communicate through written language. Mandarin uses Chinese characters. (history of chinese characters, also considering and possibly mentioning that those who learn chinese as their native learner learn pronunciation and it impacts typing different, as a second language we use the alphabet and they use juyin -- i think) The Chinese character for dog is BLANK. However, once a person knows a character writing it isn't a free for all, In order to write the character properly a person must learn the correct stroke order and follow essentially the writing order rules --which become more second nature over time especially since characters share similar parts and pieces called radicals. As people write characters faster and faster having the correct stroke order becomes essential in recognizing a character. Both pinyin for Chinese as a second language learner, tone and stroke order of the character are all essential parts and pieces to learn Mandarin Chinese. All these different facets of learning Chinese are discussed in ARTICLE, along with all Mandarin learners being able to confirm this from their own experience.

The use of the internet has also greatly changed the way Chinese is learned and the available resources that people have to be able to learn Chinese and other foreign languages. This was the major discussion among most articles that have to do with learning Chinese as a second language. The articles referenced different technologies Chinese as a foreign language learners use, recommend, and were working on developing. However, one limitation of these articles is that most of them are out of date. While the ideas still relate, most of these technologies that are mentioned don't. More modern articles in discussion about technology that aid in learning and teaching Chinese as a second language are scarce. In order to find more modern technologies searching on the web proved most effective. However, even there many of the GitHub repositories connected to these topics and ideas were out of date and had deprecated code. On the other hand some of the more modern technologies like Skritter and Anki require fees to enable access to the full repository. Skritter is an app that works with writing Chinese and Japanese Language. This app focuses specifically on stroke order and writing. Anki is an advanced flash card app. Pleco is a free Chinese dictionary app that many Chinese as a second language learners use.

Background and motivation
In talking about this prototype and my senior comp there are two considerations, what has been done and my goal for the finalized project. This article will discuss both along with the steps necessary in order to get from one to the other. The idea for this project comes from an understanding of the importance of learning languages and a desire to see more resources that will aid people in learning languages. This tool is specifically focused on Mandarin Chinese speaking and writing, as it can often be one of the harder languages for English speakers to learn, so that among other reasons is why it is important to have free and a variety of different tools to aid in learning Chinese.


## Prototype


## Preliminary Results and Outcomes

Because Chinese can be qualified as a difficult language to learn this tool will provide a different way to engage with and learn the language. The ultimate goal is to create a physical device about the size of a 2x2" or 3x3", bigger than a smart watch but smaller than the size of your hand. This device will be for studying Mandarin. What software would be implemented on this device? Well the software would include at the most basic level a flashcard software. Once the flashcards are created the svgs from the GitHub repository Makemehanzi will be called and added to the stored flashcards or implemented once flashcards are reviewed. This way the user will be able to not only be reminded of the words and of the pinyin but also of the stroke order. 
Right now the work I've done reflects what it will take to create the different flashcard libraries. I have been working on reading in a picture first and then editing that picture. The next step is to extract the text from the picture and then use the extracted text to make flashcards from there. 

So the goal is to have a program that takes in files/pictures from textbooks and then turns them into flashcards. Right now at this level I have a working prototype that takes in a read pictures using open CV. I was hoping to use Open CV in order to evaluate the svgs from the Makemehanzi GitHub repository but there is no resource in Open CV resource that evaluates pictures quite like that. I used an online resource to extract the text from the scanned picture. The goal will be to use an open source library to do this so that all the steps of this platform will happen in house, rather than being outsourced and users having to go to different libraries for the different steps. Also in the src folder is a basic layout of a website to show how the flashcards will be stored. The basic layout from the website was from Aleth GitHub library. I leveraged this basic layout and then I added the functionality to store flashcards TODO. In addition, I connected the webpages and added a menu bar to access all of the pages. Creating these flashcards will eventually become an automated process. So this website is just where there will be stored and it will be the interface the user interacts with to access their flashcards. I then plan to iterate through the html and xml files in the Inkstone GitHub Repository. I will read the lines in and split them on the commas. Then the value at index 1 I would code to add to the front of the flash card and the values at index 2 and 3, the pinyin and definition respectively I will add to the back side of the card. At least that is where the project is heading, before putting it on the device and continuing to work with Inkstone and hopefully modernize that code. 

### testing
I will be testing this product based on the code written. I will plan to run this code using a command line prompt which will require the user to set up poetry so that they can run the program. (It might also be easier to do away with all of that because I also want to make this repository the independent as possible so that hopefully it will have a longer shelf life, if that makes sense.) I will create a testing folder and test files and that will be how I test the file to ensure it is working. I was working on installing poetry and using that to install formatting dependencies like ruff and mypy along with a testing command. However, this currently still isn't completely working. Right now the project requires the user's interaction in order to determine if the size of the picture was changed and if it was successfully cropped. Another idea for future works will be to automate this process as well, and automatically crop the photo by extracting the foreground, which there is a Open CV library relating to. In conclusion, as far as testing goes I plan to add formatting checks and test suites/cases checks to gatorgrade and be able to evaluate my code that way. Moving forward these are the required checks and tests I will implement based on the code I have already implemented. The checks will ensure that the photo opens, it can be resized, it can be cropped, (using an online platform img to text translator), flashcards can be made, flashcards can be saved, and the website pages connect to each other.

## Conclusions and Future Work

I plan to continue working on this project in 600/610. This is one reason that there is a lot of code in the src folder that seems seemingly unconnected right now. Although I don't have one solid artifact for my prototype I have many of the small pieces that are laying the foundation for this project moving forward. (I plan to have done a lot over the summer and how much I do will determine how far I get and ultimately how much that I will be able to do.)
There are many different directions this project could go. When I think about future work and future results I am considering different ways to take this project to the next level and advance it further. (Future results could also include writing an article about the importance of this project which is my comp but sending it to a conference and submitting my tool to pypi so that others can access it.) This final platform for this  tool could just be a website platform the takes in a picture and then based on the uploaded picture extracts the text and creates a set of flashcards based on the test. (This will be a process to automate too, like evaluating the background and then cropping it based on that, this could also involved user interaction to confirm that the correct part of the image is being cropped, like those scanner apps, even apple files includes this feature.) Then the user will scroll through and confirm the created flashcard set and make any necessary edits before confirming the set. The platform will either call the svg file or attach it to the flashcard so that the user will be able to see the stroke order after every time they review a word. I also place to add an option with every set to choose if the user would prefer the stroke order to be displayed for not. Beyond implementing this as a website I could also explore the path of implementing this as an app. This would involve creating a working website and then transfering the code to Swift to implement the code in Apple devices. I would have to do more research in order to determine what it would take to implement the code in Android devices as well.
Another future avenue of research on the software will be applying the techniques and resources that this tools uses and adapting them to be applicable to languages beyond Chinese. Implementing other language libraries would most likely be a lot easier than implementing Mandarin because most other languages have alphabets. In addition to software, creating the physical device could also be another avenue of research depending on how far and how long the other parts of this project end up taking.
Beyond just creating a physical device another aspect of this project could be user interacting with the device. This will be a large step and be much harder to implement, but with user interaction the user could practice physically writing characters and be evaluated on that as they study with their flashcards. Adding user interaction would be a lot harder to implement because it has to account for user input and direction of strokes and order of strokes, and many other factors. For now to make this project more basic I will just work to show the svg. (maybe i could just reach out to Skritter and skel my idea and they can make and then sell the device).  The Inkstone GitHub repository does has user interaction in a similar way to Skritter, though Inkstone is free and open source. Working with Inkstone is also a future work but right now it is a deprecated library. This might be one direction I choose to go with my comp in the fall. Even if I don't end up trying to restore the library I will still probably work with it and work to understand it so that I can leverage code from it to add user interaction, and their library of characters.
Another idea could possibly be to download a language dictionary or library and use that to make the flashcards, and have this aspect as the main focus of my project. If I went this route I would most likely leverage and AI software or some other type of existing software to aid int eh process of turning pictures from textbooks into flashcards.
