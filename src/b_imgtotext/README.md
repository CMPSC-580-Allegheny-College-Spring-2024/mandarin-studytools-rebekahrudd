How to use the text to image scanner

right now it is using streamlit but i want to change this, becuase eprecated stuff is a pain

This website converts it
https://brandfolder.com/workbench/extract-text-from-image
I can clean it up here with code or on the website and then make it an iterable csv file to make flashcards from, maybe I should just straight to that and take code from the inkstone and makemehanzi folders
